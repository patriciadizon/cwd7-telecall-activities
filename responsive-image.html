        <h5>Butterfly</h5>
        <p>A butterfly is a flying insect with a small body and large, often colorful wings. Some gardeners plant specific flowers that attract butterflies. Butterflies are closely related to moths, which also have wings that are large in proportion to their bodies and antennae. The scales, which are arranged in colorful designs unique to each species, are what gives the butterfly its beauty. Like all other insects, butterflies have six legs and three main body parts: head, thorax (chest or mid section) and abdomen (tail end). They also have two antennae and an exoskeleton. Butterfly wings are covered in thousands of microscopic scales that are split into two to three layers. Each of these scales has multiple layers that are separated by air. Due to iridescence, the more layers the wings have for light to pass through, the more times the light is reflected.</p>
